	* util.c (get_size_string): put this function here since I 
	have it in about three different places already

	* proctable.c: make the mem column a string and use 
	get_size_string for nice display

2001-09-29  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Initial port to GNOME 2.0 platform. Too much changes to detail

	* proctable.c: port to GtkTreeview from e-tree

2001-09-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* release 0.10.3

	* interface.c: comment out the "about process" item as it is
	stupid right now. Maybe in the future when we get a good
	help browser.

2001-09-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* prettytable.c: change GDK_INTERP_NEAREST to HYPER for
	better scaling of the icons.

2001-09-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: make the minimum update interval for
	the process viewer be 1 sec otherwise I see crashing on
	startup (and it uses too much cpu otherwise)

2001-09-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procman.c: don't load the desktop files twice

	* interface.c: fix lines needing removal so this compiles

2001-09-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: check to see if load-graph is not NULL in

	show the sys tab for testing purposes

2001-09-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: make the disks frame seperated from the graphs
	by a vpaned
	
	* procman.[c,h]: save the paned pos

2001-09-19  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* load-graph.c: Remove extra #include <config.h>
	* prettytable.c: Move #include <config.h> to the top
	to make i18n work. Please try now.
 	
2001-09-19  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* proctable.c (free_info): call gdk_pixbuf_unref to free the 
	pixbuf and a memory leak.

2001-09-19  Kevn Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* callbacks.c (cb_simple_dialog_close): call gtk_main_quit
	to close the app

	* interface.c: some reshuffling of the UI code. don't call
	gtk_widget_show on the main window untill all updating
	has been done.
	Improve the ctrl-alt-del dialog by giving a title

	* prettytable.c: call gettext () on the string since
	the app names arent getting translated. Still doesn't 
	work.

	* procdialogs.c: remove some debugging spew. Change a pref
	tab label to match the main notebook tab label.

	* procman.c: load the desktop files after the main window
	has been created. This seems to reduce the amount of 
	crashing due to the delay loading. Seems that the problem is
	unthreadsafeness of some gnome functions.
	Also let the simple dialog share the gtk main loop instead of
	calling gnome_dialog_run. This makes it truly modeless

	* proctable.c: remove some unneeded commented stuff.

2001-09-16  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* proctable.c: improve the search. Use strstr to search for
	any instance of the search string. Also find the next match
	when the same search string is used. Also make sure that
	that the matching process is actually displayed.

2001-09-16  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procman.c: add new variable desktop_load_finish to monitor
	the delay loading. Call pthrea_init here and do pthread_join
	when the loading is done.

	* prettytable.c: just load the .desktop files in the thread
	function

	* interface.c: change "end app..." to "close app..."

2001-09-15  Yves Kurz <kurzy1@isbiel.ch>

	* infoview.c: Changed the frame alignment to default.
	* interface.c: ditto
	* procdialogs.c: ditto

2001-09-14  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Add a command line argument to run procman in a simple view.
	This would be suitable for a ctrl-alt-delete dialog.

	* procman.c: add new config option for the simple view. Don't save
	settings if set. Also fix suitable defaults. Add command args
	to show the dialog

	* interface.c: do a gnome_dialog if in simple view.

	* callbacks.c: New function to logout, but does nothing yet.
	Check to see if timeouts exist before removing them at app
	exit.

	* proctable.c: load a different spec file if in simple view

	* simple.etspec: new spec file. Headers are not shown so this doesn't
	need to be translated.

	* infovew.c: don't make the hbox uniform so the info frame can
	expand a little

2001-09-09  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* release 0.10.2

2001-09-08  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	a second time. Also do the utf8 stuff when adding "thread" to the
	name

	* util.c: fix memory leaks

2001-09-08  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: provide feedback when password is wrong. Just
	put up a simple error message

	* util.c (su_run_with_password): pass the return value from
	exec_su
	(exec_su): return -1 if password is wrong.

	* interface.c: cosmetic improvements, put % in the graph
	titles to make explicit that it is the % that is being
	displayed

2001-09-06  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* favorites.c: add a little padding around the "remove from
	list" button label.

	* interface.c: add 'end process' and 'kill process' to main menu.
	Put the hidden process manager into the settings menu.

	* callbacks.c (cb_[kill,end]_process): new callbacks for the new
	menuitems.

2001-09-06  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: make disk frame label center align to be
	similar to the graph frame labels.

	* procdialogs.c: Make minimum timeout for proc view be 0.5
	as any lower uses too much cpu on my computer. Make the disk
	timeout mimum be 1 sec and the adjust amount be 1 sec
	intervals in the spin button

2001-09-04  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procman.c: new config variables to save window geometry.
	Save the window size on exit.

	* interface.c: set the default size.

	* memmaps.c: remove some debugging stuff and the connecting 
	to the right click signal.

2001-09-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: call load_graph_draw on the configure event. This
	removes the slight delay in drawing when switching tabs.

	* callbacks.c (cb_switch_page): remove the calls to load_graph_draw
	here since they did not help and the graph was not visible at that
	point so their effects were not noticable.

	* procman.c: make the default grid color a light green. Hopefully
	people dont' find it too ugly. Please someone provide me with a way
	to make a nice looking graph. I need help here. Pleeeease.

2001-09-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: cosmetic improvements to the prefs dialog
	mainly making the two tabs have similar layouts.

2001-09-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c (create_kill_dialog): pass in the signal now
	so either SIGKILL or SIGTERM can use this dialog. Change the
	button labels accordingly.

	* callbacks.c: use the create_kill_dailog properly adding
	the signal to the argument.

	* interface.c: left align the disk name and mount point

	* util.c: fix a memory leak

2001-09-02  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: improve the renice dialog by adding a label
	indicating whether the priority is high etc.

	* infoview.c: sync the priority label with that of the renice
	dialog

2001-09-01  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c (create_root_password_dialog) pass a gchar here
	as a argument for the dialog text. This way a seperate dialog
	asking if the user wants to enter the password is not needed. 
	Beautify the dialog a bit
	(create_renice_dialog) change the button to read Change Priority
	instead of renice.

	* procactions.c: pass the root password text to 
	create_root_passsword_dialog

2001-08-31   Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: left justify the disk name and mount point
	clist entries.
	
	* procactions.c: do the su stuff on renice. Slightly different
	error message for when the user does not have permission or
	when they have permission but try to lower the nice value.

	* procactions.c (renice): pass procdata in here in order to 
	pass it to the password dialog.

	* procdialogs.c (renice_accept): pass procdata ro renice

2001-08-31  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: add notebook tab for process viewer and
	system monitor settings. Add settings for graph colors, and
	graph/disk update intervals.

	* callbacks.c: change gpointer to a procdata instead of the clist
	so that you don't have to access the clist to use this function
	anywhere in the code. The clist is now stored in procdata.

	* interface.c: pass procdata to cb_update_disks

	* load_graph.c: change back to 2 pixel line width

	* prettytable.c: remove some debugging stuff. 
	(prettytable_load_async) return if thread could not be created.

	* procman.[c,h]: add config variable for disk update interval.
	Add to ProcInfo structure booleans if process is thread and
	if it has a .desktop file.

	* proctable.c: some reordering of the code initiated by the fact that
	(thread) was not being added anymore. A benefit is that we don't
	call prettytable_get_icons more than needed.
	(update_info): don't try to get icon or name if it has already
	been checked (info->has_desktop_file is either 0 or 1). Be
	sure to readd (thread) if the name has changed.
	(get_info): check to see if process is a thread here and set
	info->is_thread accordingly. 
	Set has_desktop_file to 0 or 1 if the desktop files have been
	scanned at this point.
	(insert_info_to_tree): now add process to info->parent_node
	if it has a parent. Don't show if info->is_thread = FALSE and
	we are not supossed to show threads.

2001-08-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* prettytable.c (pretty_table_add_table): fix memory leak.
	gnome_datadir_file return string should be freed. Add
	$prefix/applets to the search directories to get some icons
	for the applets

2001-08-28  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: add line divisions to the graph. Make the data
	lines wider (3 pixels - maybe too large).

	* proctable.c: add hack to see if process is graphical. Check
	the memory maps to see if it links to libX11. #ifdefed out
	right now - not sure if it is too useful

2001-08-27  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* infoview.c, callbacks.c, load-graph.c: mark the memory size
	strings for translation. bug #59597

2001-08-27  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* callbacks.c: mark the author strings for translation
	Fixes bug #59595.

2001-08-26  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procdialogs.c: connect to "close" signal for renice dialog.
	Don't popup a new dialog if another already exists.

	* favorites.c: again connect to "close" signal, and only
	do gnome_dialog_close if the close button is pressed.

2001-08-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Fix bug #59548 by only showing utf8 names for the e-tree
	* procman.h: add name_utf8 string to ProcInfo structure

	* proctable.c (get_name): do the utf8 thing on the name for the
	name_utf8 string and g_strdup the name for the info->name
	(proctable_get_value): return info->name_utf8 here instead
	of info->name.

2001-08-25  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* memmaps.c: connect to the "close" signal since "destroy" was
	causing corruption when save the e-tree state file. Try to
	raise the dialog if it already exists. For the close button
	just call gnome_dialog_close, don't call it in the "close" 
	signal handler. Clear the memmaps data at close time

2001-08-24  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: add a Kill Process item to right click
	menu because there are times when it is needed.

	* procactions.c (kill_process): add an extra argument to
	determine the signal sent.

	* callbacks.c: add popup_menu_end_process to send SIGTERM and
	change popup_menu_kill_process to send SIGKILL and ignore the
	warning dialog.

	* procdialogs.c: call kill_process with SIGTERM.

2001-08-24  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: Put disks updating on timeout. Move mount 
	directory to the last column of the clist since it is the 
	least interesting.

	* procman.[c,h]: new config value for the graph updating
	interval. Remove the g_free to the e-tree state save file
	names since I think that may be why procman leaves behind
	weird files.

	* load-graph.c: use the new timeout config variable for the
	graph timeout.

	* callbacks.c (cb_update_disks): clear the clist and
	repopulate.

2001-08-24  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: fix bug #59466, a typo in wording. Also slightly
	modify another string. Sorry translators :(

2001-08-23  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: connect to the "delete_event" signal as that
	is more right than "destroy" and gets rid of the bug where
	widgets are destroyed before the "destroy" signal is emitted.

	* callbacks.c: now cb_app_delete for the "delete_event" signal
	and cb_exit for the exit menu item.

2001-08-23  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: fill in the status bar message for the menuitems

2001-08-23  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: make the graph one pixel smaller than the frame
	so it always shows up.
	Initialize the data points to -1 and then don't display them.
	
2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: make the graphs above each other to display
	more history.

	* load-graph.c: move the frame back behind the data. Do a crude
	hack to check if the data has any value and don't draw a line
	if not so. Gets rid of the line having to do with the fact that
	the data for time periods before the app started is zero. Bump
	the number of points up since we now have more space.

2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: add a new column to the disks showing used space.
	center justify each element in the disk list.

	* procman.c: add default colors

2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Ability to save colors

	* procman.h: the config variables for the colors are now
	GdkColors

2001-08-22  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Some UI to change the cpu/mem/swap colors. Still need to
	save to disk though

	* callbacks.c cb_[cpu,mem,swap]_color_changed: callback for
	the gnome color pickers, change the current colors

	* interface.c: add the color pickers. Add the swap used label
	as a caption to the now Memory / Swap graph.

	* load-graph.c: # of colors is now g->n + 2 ie one for each
	graphed item, one for background and one for frame. Draw frame
	after data so it is on top. calculate swap in get_memory

	* procman.c: new config variable for the swap color.

	* procman.h: move the LoadGraph structure here.

2001-08-21  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Configurable colors for the graphs. Need to add UI in the
	settings dialog still.
	* procman.[c,h]: add config values for colors

	* callbacks.c: add a FIXME about using gnome_url_show

	* interface.c: update the calls to loag_graph_new
	passing the colors

	* load_graph.c: do the color dance

2001-08-21  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c: change the "" to NULL in the UIINFOs as that
	seemed to cause problems

2001-08-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c: fix the bug where the graph would initialize the data
	on first view. Save the old data in the update not in the drawing.
	Chnage the g_return_if_fail to a regular return since I know
	why this routine is called after disp is NULL and it is harmless. 

	* util.c: remove some ddebugging stuff

	* procdialogs.c: make the entry default to focus, and the enter
	button be default

	* interface.c: make the frame labels for the cpu and mem graphs
	be centered

2001-08-19  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* util.c: get the root stuff working! No need to do an extra
	fork. The problem was that exit was being called earlier on
	the parent process. Now only call exit on the child. Release
	coming soon.

2001-08-19  Tige Chastain (tigechastain@home.com)

	* favorites.c: Added checking to empty hidden processes window.

2001-08-19  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* util.c: call fork before execlp so the procman doesn't quit
	when you kill the process

2001-08-19  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* util.c: new misc file. Contains the exec as root stuff for
	now

	* procactions.c: do the root dialog on kill if permission denied.
	Update some strings

	* procdialogs.c (create_root_password_dialog): new dialog to
	get the root password

2001-08-18  Tige Chastain <tigechastain@home.com>

	* procactions.c: provide feedback when renice and kill don't
	work.

2001-08-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_draw): put a g_return_val_if_fail
	on the main window to deal with a crash on exit.
	Slow the update down for a better display. Need to not hardcode
	these values.

	* interface.c: some update of the labels.

	* callbacks.c: end the timers on exit. The load_graph_draw
	is still being called even after the window has been 
	destroyed.

2001-08-18  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* callbcaks.c: remove cb_progress_meter... Force a graph update
	upon a tab switch.

	* interface.c: update some of the labels for the cpu and mem
	graphs. Also don't show a disk if it has zero size - seems to 
	do the work of not showing /proc etc.

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_draw): not static anymore so the 
	graph can be drawn in callbacks.c. Set the graph width and height
	here so we are always guarenteed the allocation->[height,width] are
	correct. 
	(get_memory): put in the memory values for the labels

	* proctable.c: add a FIXME and remove the progress meter stuff.

2001-08-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c (get_size_string): display the disk space sizes nicer.

	* load-graph.c (load_graph_[start,stop]): make it so data
	is continually taken but don't do the drawing untill a call
	to load_graph_start. Thus switching back and forth the data
	will remain.

2001-08-16  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Beginnings of graphical display of cpu history and mem usage.
	Remove the cpu/mem/swap meters from the main window and add
	back the app-bar. Now there are two notebook tabs for 
	the process list and the sys monitor

	* callbacks.c (cb_switch_page): new callback when the tab is
	switched. Turn off the process updating or cpu/mem updating
	when relevant.
	
	* interface.c: seperate the process tab UI from the sysmon. Add
	them as seperate tabs.

	* procman.[c,h]: add new gint config variable indicating the
	current tab

	all the menu items. Change window titile to be "Procman System
	Monitor".

	* procdialogs.c: Improve the renice dialog. Use an hscale, put

	a cancel button is more appropriate

2001-08-07 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c : move the popup menu callbacks back to
	callbacks.c. Add a new menuitem to get info about the
	process. Just tries to man:process name.

	on the process command name. Perhaps there is a better way.

	* proctable.c (get_process_name): change this to get the
	process name and process command. Thus shortened command names
	should no longer be in procman.

2001-08-07 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* interface.c (create_main_window): hook up to the key press
	signal for the e-tree. Also remove a duplicated

	<tigechastain@home.com>

	* interface.c (create_main_window): create the popup menu here
	and save as a global variable. Make the menu nicer.
	(do_popup_menu): rename to avoid conflict with said global
	variable. Now just pop the menu up
	(popup_menu*): place callbacks here and call gtk_popdown_menu
	on the global GtkMenu.

2001-08-05 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procman.c: add new boolean config option to do the delay load

	the icons using a seperate thread.
	(thread_func): new function to actually load the icons within
	the thread.

	* interface.c (idle_func): call the new async functions to load
	icons

	* proctable.c (update_info): check to see if icon doesn't exist
	and if so try to find one. Not ideal in that it means we 
	constantly check for icons for processes that don't have them.

	* prettytable.h: remove unneeded stuf

	* procman.c (procman_data_new): change default "view as" to 
	my processes.

	as that caused a segfault in e-tree that won't be fixed for
	Gal 1.0
	(remove_button_clicked): call the e-tree ForEach function so
	all selected processes are remove from the list. Then call
	fill_tree_with_info to clear the tree and repopulate.

	a memory leak.

	* procman.c (procman_free_data): free strings pointing to
	.etspec files. Fixes memory leak.

	unneeded comments

2001-08-03 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* procman.h: add new gchar to ProcInfo structure for the command
	args

	tooltip will make it go away.

	* procman.h: add new gint for the progress meter timeouts
	so they can be removed at app destruction

	* callbacks.c (cb_app_destroy): remove the timeouts. I think
	they were still being triggered even though the widgets were
	destroyed.

        the process is blacklisted.

        * proctable.c (update_info): insert process and remove taking

        a bug where a process was continusouly inserted leading
        to (thread) being appended over and over

        * procdialogs.c (creare_preferences_dialog): update comment
        to be correct.

        * infoview.c (create_infoview): cosmetic improvements

        * prettytable.c (_load_path): remove g_strdowns so app names
        will be upper case per Seth's suggestion. Nautilus doesn't
        get an icon so I need to check into that.

2001-07-12 Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	For now don't do the favorites. Instead make a blacklist
	of processes the user don't want to see. I think this is
	more useful than defining favorites.

	processes that the user doesn't want to see.

	setting certain widgets insensitive at startup, just send 
	an "unselect" signal.
