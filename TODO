-- 1.2 new features --
[ ] Should be able to drag a process to "end process" button and
    "more info" button and do the appropriate action
[ ] color rows depending on cpu usage 

-- later --
[ ] Perhaps a custom view like show only processes using above 10 MB etc
    but perhaps it's a feature overkill (it's a process viewer after all
    - it should probably remain simple)
